# `min-terminal`

This is `min-terminal`, a little side-project that I started to get more comfortable with `C`. In the future I hope to use this terminal as my daily driver (I currently use [`st`](https://st.suckless.org/)) and I intend for it to be usable by me with my workflow. This means that, from most perspectives, `min-terminal` is simultaneously over-engineered and severely lacking in features, but for me it's perfect :-))

That said, if you wanna hack on this I'd be happy to help you with your own fork.

## TODOs

These are not in any particular order.

- [X] Use `OpenGL` instead of `Xlib` for rendering.
- [ ] Show Cursor.
- [ ] Resizeable window.
- [ ] Limited ligature support.
- [ ] Cache rasterized glyphs on the GPU.
- [ ] Use something other than [`stb_truetype.h`](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_truetype.h) for rasteriziing glyphs (security issues).
- [ ] Pass the [vttest](https://www.invisible-island.net/vttest/) suite (except for blinking text, I don't care about that).
- [ ] Pass the [esctest](https://github.com/ThomasDickey/esctest2) suite.
- [ ] Some sort of dialog for when errors and unknown escape sequences occur.
- [ ] Vim keybindings built-in.
- [ ] Copy-paste.
- [ ] Scrollback buffer.
